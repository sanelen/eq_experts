serenity-junit

This project was developed using Serenity BDD 
Although my best experience is with pure selenium and cucumber I decided to go with serenity.
Its an experimental project to show how Serenity BDD works 
This project runs on chrome-driver for mac just for this demo, if you run it on windows please download a new chrome-driver 
for your browser version : https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads 

Please use mvn-verify to run the test

The test report sits under 
target -> site -> Index  which can be run in a browser

thank you
